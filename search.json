This will include the ability to finalise the overall tax position using software.\nHMRC will provide the APIs for the software to support all of the personal data items that need to be submitted under Self Assessment. Although these elements will not be mandated through the software, there will be market demand for software that enables any user to finalise the entirety of their tax affairs.\nBy developing a product now, you will support the mandate of the service, influence its design and ensure you have a product ready for the millions of customers that will need MTD-compatible software.\nBridging software\nSome customers may wish to integrate their existing software solution for digital record keeping with another product that can submit quarterly updates, End of Period Statement, view tax liabilities, make a self assessment and final declaration, and so on. We generally refer to these products as bridging products.\nIn order to be granted production credentials for a bridging product, it must be digitally linked to software that allows customers to maintain business records required by law.\nNon-MTD products\nSoftware products who wish to selectively use Making Tax Digital for Income Tax APIs and not build a Making Tax Digital product will have to submit a business case, justifying use of a particular or multiple API’s. Such products may be granted production credentials at HMRC discretion.\nProduction approvals process for Making Tax Digital for Income Tax Self Assessment\nOur key objectives for MTD for Income Tax are to:\n\n\nensure customers have a streamlined end-to-end journey and software that supports everything a business customer needs to do to meet their Income Tax obligations\nsafeguard customer data and protect HMRC systems against fraud and criminal attack\n\nThis section of the guide explains the features your product must include before production credentials are sought, together with features you should consider building into your products.\nMinimum functionality standards\nPreviously, the production approvals process included an assessment of whether a product includes certain minimum functionality.\nIn response to developer feedback, we are content for software developers to build MTD Income Tax products iteratively and be granted production credentials for specific elements of the minimum required functionality. However, an MTD Income Tax product will only be listed on the software choices viewer when it satisfies all the requirements listed below.\nThe minimum required functionality is as follows:\n\n\nA software product must submit the fraud prevention header data required by law.\nA Making Tax Digital for Income Tax product must allow the customer to:\n\n\nCreate and maintain all business records a customer is required by law to keep in digital form (but see Bridging Software)\nSubmit quarterly update information for each business income source (self-employment, multiple self-employments, UK property income)\nHave the option to provide accounting and other adjustments and an estimate of allowances to be claimed for any business income source\nSubmit an End of Period Statement for each business income source (with declaration of completeness)\nCall for and view an estimate of their Income Tax liability for each tax year at any time\nMake a self-assessment of the tax and Class 4 National Insurance contributions due on their total taxable income and a final declaration of completeness and correctness no later than 31 January following the end of tax year in which that income is taxable\nCarry forward or set sideways (when permitted) business losses occurring in any one year as well as to apply losses incurred in earlier years against current year profits\nHave visibility of all their Class 2 National Insurance contributions (so that they can make additional voluntary contributions if they wish)\n\n\nThe Making Tax Digital for Income Tax APIs that include the endpoints for the functionality described above are:\n\n\nBusiness Details\nObligations\nBusiness Income Source Summary\nIndividuals Business End of Period Statement\nIndividual Calculations\nIndividual Losses\nIndividuals Disclosures (Class 2 NIC’s)\nBusiness Source Adjustable Summary\n\nFraud Prevention Headers\nYou must supply fraud prevention header information for all our APIs before approval can be granted and production credentials issued.\nHMRC must see evidence of fraud prevention headers being sent and be satisfied as to their level of accuracy.\nThe developer must test their fraud prevention headers and provide SDST with screenshot evidence that the correct response is received from the Test Fraud Prevention Headers API. Guidance on Fraud Prevention Headers is available.\nOverview of developer journey to production credentials\n\n\nSign in to the developer hub and register your application for sandbox testing.\nCreate a test user which is an individual to create test data.\nReview the API documentation and Income Tax end-to-end service guide.\nTest ITSA endpoints and develop your software application. Any queries during this phase should be sent to SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk.\nRegister your application for production credentials by creating a production application within your developer hub account and completing the requested sections.\nProvide testing logs and credentials used for testing to HMRC.\nDeveloper testing is reviewed by HMRC (including fraud header validity). \n\n\nIf satisfactory, you will be invited to demonstrate your product. \nIf not satisfactory, further testing and development will be required for review.\n\nThe software vendor demonstrates its software to HMRC via online screen sharing.\nProduction credentials are issued if all requirements are met. If not, further development is required and a new demonstration will be arranged.\n\nProduct build\nDevelopers have the option to either build all elements required to meet minimum functionality standards (MFS) in one go or to build these elements iteratively. If you choose to build iteratively, you will be required to demonstrate your product after each stage of the build. There are three stages, although many developers choose to develop stages 2 and 3 together.\nThe three stages are:\n\n\nIn year functionality (submitting periodic updates).\nEnd of Period (EOPs).\nFinal declaration.\n\nThe API catalogue shows which APIs are required at each stage of the build.\nTesting requirements\nHMRC requires the software to test all the APIs that they require access to. The following points relate to access to both new API subscriptions and version updates of existing API subscriptions:\n\n\nFor APIs included in the minimum functionality standards, you are required to test all endpoints shown within the documentation.\nFor APIs not included in the minimum functionality standards, you are only required to test the endpoints relating to the data sources that your software supports. Where your software doesn’t support all data items, please notify SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk separately to confirm which data items you do support, so we can take this into account when checking the testing logs.\n\nFraud prevention headers must be included in sandbox calls. A specialist team will check these and they must be confirmed as compliant before we can proceed.\nOnce testing is complete, please send details of the dummy NINO used to call the above endpoints in sandbox to SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk. You will need to contact us within 14 days of completing your API testing to enable us to view the data within our logs. SDST will advise you of the outcome of our checks within 10 working days.   \nOnce we are satisfied that the relevant APIs and endpoints have been tested satisfactorily and that calls include compliant fraud prevention headers, you will be invited to demonstrate your product. Please note, demonstration is not generally required for access to updated APIs (that is, new versions), but satisfactory testing will be required.\nProduct demonstration\nThis is the final part of the process after all preceding steps have been completed.   \nDuring your product demonstration, HMRC expects to see a consumer-ready product for each income source your software supports; for example, Self-employment, UK property, and so on. If, in addition to the MFS APIs, you have also requested access to any non-MFS APIs, you should be ready to include these in your demonstration if requested to do so by SDST.\nThe journey we expect to see for an MFS build will depend on whether you are building iteratively and if so, which stage you have built to:\nStage 1: In year build\n\n\nAuthorisation – ITSA scopes only.\nRetrieve Business Details.\nRetrieve Obligations.\nDigitally import data into the appropriate periodic update and submit.\nAutomatically trigger and display a tax calculation.\nSubmit an amended periodic update – automatically trigger and display the calculation.\nDemonstrate how your software returns and displays error messages to the customer.\n\nStage 2: EOPS\n\n\nSubmit details within the Annual Summary.\nAutomatically trigger and display a tax calculation.\nTrigger a Business Source Adjustable Summary (BSAS).\nRetrieve a BSAS.\nCreate and submit a Business Source Adjustable Summary for an accounting adjustment.\nAutomatically trigger and display a tax calculation.\nEither: \n\n\nRetrieve a Business Income Source Summary (BISS) and display it to the customer. \nOr: \nThe software may choose to create a BISS themselves by totalling the relevant information held in software and displaying it to the customer.\n\nShow EOPS Declaration Statement - this must match the statement shown in the ITSA End to End Service Guide.\nSubmit EOPS.\nDemonstrate how your software returns and displays error messages to the end user.\n\nNote: The end user must confirm they have read and agreed the declaration statement before the option to submit EOPS is made available.\nStage 3: Final Declaration\n\n\nCreate and submit a loss.\nCreate/Amend and submit disclosures (Class 2 NICs).\nTrigger a tax calculation with the finalDeclaration parameter set to “True”.\nRetrieve and display this tax calculation for the customer to review.\nShow the Final Declaration Statement – this must match the statement shown on the ITSA End to End Service Guide.\nSubmit a Final Declaration.\nDemonstrate how your software returns and displays error messages to the end user.\n\nNote: The end user must confirm they have read and agreed the declaration statement before the option to submit the Final Declaration is made available.\nImportant Considerations\n\n\nBuild functionality to allow business customers to report income from non-business sources that meets your customer model.\nConsider the one-hour delay as part of the software workflow to update the status of obligations.\nConsider a 5-second delay before retrieving the calculation.\nConsider developing guidelines within the software for relevant users, including a reference to HMRC user interface journeys for customers and agents.\nUse APIs as efficiently as possible to avoid exceeding the rate limit.\nBuild relevant error responses for your software to deal with exceptions.\nCorrect MTD gateway credentials or agent services credentials need to be used when logging into the system when authorising your software.\nConsider providing notifications to customers when periodic submissions are due.\nConsider building functionality that allows the customer to request a tax calculation at any time.\n\nTerms of use\nYou must comply with our terms of use. You must accept the terms of use before we can issue you with production credentials.\nSoftware choices\nSoftware Choices is a service designed to help users find compatible software for Making Tax Digital for Income Tax that meets their needs.\nAn updated version is being developed with filters to help users find products that fit their specific requirements. For instance, a user may wish to find bridging software instead of a standalone product, or a product that suits their accessibility needs. It will also include a filter to find software that is also compatible with Making Tax Digital for VAT.\nSoftware vendors have the option for their software to be listed on software choices as software in development once production credentials have been approved. To be listed as software available now, vendors must demonstrate: \n\n\nthey have developed to minimum functionality standards, by being granted access to the full set of APIs listed in the minimum functionality standards section\nthey can complete the successful onboarding for a customer - sign up, authorise software, and retrieve obligations\nthey can submit a periodic update for a customer for each business income source\n\nHMRC staff will monitor this activity in real time if they feel it is necessary. HMRC will then perform final checks before allowing a software product to be listed on GOV.UK.\nWe advise users to speak to their appointed tax agent (if they have one) before making a decision on software.\nFree-to-use software\nThe government has committed to the availability of free software for small businesses mandated to use MTD for income tax. HMRC strongly encourages all developers to consider producing a free version of their MTD for Income Tax product for this customer group.\nBy ‘small businesses’ we mean that eligibility for free software will apply where the business meets all of these conditions:\n\n\nit is an individual (self-employed or a landlord) or a simple partnership\nit is not VAT registered\nit has no employees\nit has a turnover (gross annual income from all business sources) of less than £85,000\nit uses cash basis accounting\n\nFor the avoidance of any doubt, there is no expectation that a free product will include VAT, Corporation Tax or PAYE functionality.\nIn addition to the minimum standards set out in the terms of use, and the general functionality standards applicable to all MTD for Income Tax software, we expect any free software product you provide to small businesses to:\n\n\nenable the provision of a dataset that correlates to the current SA103S self-employment supplementary page (short)\nenable the provision of a dataset that correlates to the current SA105 UK property or SA106 foreign property pages, where the number of properties does not exceed one\nprovide a reasonable level of guidance, help and support to users (HMRC is open to views on what might be ‘reasonable’ for a free product and will publish further advice on this in due course)\nallow the end user to own and have access to all their records created using the software product (past and present) to enable them to retrieve data and promptly export it if necessary\nbe free for the business to use to comply with their MTD for Income Tax obligations for a full annual accounting period on the understanding the business continues to meet the eligibility criteria below\n\nHMRC would not require free software to link or integrate with an Agent product.\nFinalise business income End of Period Statement (EOPS)\nBusiness or Agent able to submit End of Period Statement through software\nThis is the process that allows the customer to finalise the profit or loss for any one source of business income.\nAn EOPS must be completed for each source of business income the customer has (similar to the current Income Tax process for the SA103, SA105 and SA106 schedules). For example, if a customer has one self-employment business and one property business they will have to complete two EOPS.\nEOPS relates to the accounting period or basis period for each source of business income and cannot be completed before the end of that period.\nCustomers may complete their EOPS at any point after the end of the accounting period and do not have to wait until the 31 January deadline. This helps customers manage their business income in line with the business accounts. However, the deadline to complete is 31 January, Year 2.\nThe process will take into account all the periodic and annual data already provided by the customer throughout the year.\nCustomers must make sure they are confident with the information they have provided and add any additional information they have. This is likely to include tax and accounting adjustments, allowances or reliefs.\nEOPS process\n\n\n\n\nThe customer inputs information about allowances and adjustments for the business income source. They can provide this information throughout the year, but must do it before they complete the EOPS.\nDepending on the business income type you need to submit, the software calls the Retrieve a Self-Employment Annual Submission, Retrieve a Historic Non-FHL UK Property Business Annual Submission\nor Retrieve a Historic FHL UK Property Business Annual Submission. This step is optional, but we recommend it to ensure you are getting the most up-to-date information.\nThe customer views the allowances and adjustment information and updates relevant information.\nDepending on the business income type you need to update, the software submits information using the Create and Amend Self-Employment Annual Submission,\nCreate and Amend a Historic Non-FHL UK Property Business Annual Submission or Create and Amend a Historic FHL UK Property Business Annual Submission.\nHMRC receives and stores information\nThe software calls the Trigger a Self Assessment Tax Calculation endpoint to get the calculation.\nHMRC receives the request and returns a Calculation ID (calculationId) software must use this when calling the Self Assessment Tax Calculation endpoints.\nThe software receives the calculationId. Note: you could display the calculation to customers at this point if you choose, if you do follow steps 20 and 21 in the periodic update section.\nThe customer wants to make some accounting adjustments following the business accounts being finalised.\nThe software calls the BSAS API.\nHMRC returns summary totals of all the information for that business income source.\nThe software displays information to the customer.\nThe customer makes adjustments, confirms and submits.\nThe software sends information to HMRC using the BSAS API.\nHMRC confirms receipt and stores the information.\nThe software calls the relevant endpoints to retrieve the calculation.\n\nNote: the Tax Calculation can take up to 5 seconds to run, so we recommend the software waits 5 seconds – this is optional, the software does not have to retrieve the tax calculation information at this point.\n\n\nList Business Source Adjustable Summaries\nTrigger a Business Source Adjustable Summary\nRetrieve a Self-Employment Business Source Adjustable Summary (BSAS)\nSubmit Self-Employment Accounting Adjustments\nRetrieve a UK Property Business Source Adjustable Summary (BSAS)\nSubmit UK Property Accounting Adjustments\nRetrieve a Foreign Property Business Source Adjustable Summary (BSAS)\nSubmit Foreign Property Accounting Adjustments\n\nEnd-to-end user journey\nThese journeys show examples of use:\n\n\nIncome Tax Self Assessment (ITSA) set up activities\nretrieving obligations\nsubmitting periodic updates for Self Employment and property businesses\nsubmitting annual updates for Self Employment and property businesses\nretrieving a tax calculation\nmaking changes to previously submitted data\nfinalising business income End of Period Statement (EOPS)\nproviding information about how to treat a loss\nmaking a final declaration\nITSA (MTD) close down activities\n\n","url":"/documentation/overview.html"},"15":{"title":"HMRC online services","content":"HMRC online services\nPeople who have signed up for Making Tax Digital for Income Tax can sign into HMRC online services to access relevant services.

For example:\n[Test Fraud Prevention Headers API](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/txm-fph-validator-api/)\nNotice that the version number is intentionally omitted from the end of the URL. This results in the link automatically pointing to the latest version.\nCreating an anchor link to the latest version of an API endpoint\nTo create an anchor link, you need to do the following:\n\n\nRename the page, appending .erb. This is to indicate that the page contains embedded Ruby code.\nAdd the following link code to the page:\n\n\u003c % = make_a_link(\"api-name\", \"anchor-name\", \"Link text\") % \u003e\nThe anchor name is the ID of the anchor in the OAS document. The link text is the text that appears in the link.\nThe markup will contain a link to the most recent version of the api. Note that the anchor is all code after the # in the url.\n\n\nHere’s an example of the correctly rendered link code:\nTrigger A Self Assessment Tax Calculation\nFor example, the List All Businesses endpoint link uses this code:\n[List All Businesses](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/business-details-api/1.0/oas/page#/paths/~1individuals~1business~1details~1%7Bnino%7D~1list/get)\nNotice the “business-details-api/1.0” embedded in the middle. This solution involves constructing the URL from the three building blocks, which you place within the “make_a_link” code. The “make_a_link” code then constructs the link with the version number always pointing to the latest version.\nIn this example:\n\n\napi-name = business-details-api\nanchor-name = /paths/~1individuals~1business~1details~1%7Bnino%7D~1list/get\nLink text = List All Businesses\n\nSo the link code you would add in this example is:\n\u003c % = make_a_link(\"business-details-api\", \"/paths/~1individuals~1business~1details~1%7Bnino%7D~1list/get\", \"List All Businesses\")  % \u003e\nSearch and Replace Regular Expressions\nTo speed up the process of converting from markdown link coding to the anchor link coding, you can use the following search and replace regular expressions:\nSearch\n\\[(.*)\\]\\((https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/)(.*\\/)[0-9]+.[0-9]/oas/page#(.*?)\\)\nReplace\n\u003c % = make_a_link(\"$3\", \"$4\",

declaration’ is now used instead of the term ‘crystallisation’. Endpoints with ‘crystallisation’ or ‘crystallise’ in their names will continue to be used until further notice.\nFinal declaration is the process that allows customers to finalise their tax position for any one tax year, taking into account all sources of chargeable income and gains, whether business income or otherwise.\nIt is also the process by which most formal claims for reliefs and allowances and any deductions are made, where these were previously included within a Self Assessment tax return.\nCustomers are able to tell us at this point (subject to the existing limits) how they wish any losses available to them to be treated.\nCustomers can make a final declaration from 6 April Year 1. The deadline for final declaration is 31 January Year 2. The software should remind customers to help them to meet this deadline.\nBefore starting the final declaration journey, the software package must ensure that for the relevant tax year, the customer:\n\n\nhas finalised EOPS for all their businesses (self-employment, uk-property and foreign-property)\nhas already provided their entire income; for example, interest, dividends, other SA schedules\ndoes not have any additional information to provide\n\nWe suggest that you first check there are no validation errors by retrieving the self-assessment metadata using the Retrieve A Self Assessment Tax Calculation endpoint.\nTo trigger a self assessment tax calculation for the given tax year, you use the Trigger A Self Assessment Tax Calculation endpoint with the finalDeclaration query parameter set to true.\nIf there are errors, the calculation is not generated. To view the error messages, call the Retrieve A Self Assessment Tax Calculation endpoint.\nTo prevent the errors from being generated, the customer must go back and amend the digital records. The software should resubmit the revised summary totals for the relevant periods, then call the Trigger A Self Assessment Tax Calculation endpoint again.\nProviding information about how to treat a loss\nLosses and claims\nA self-employed business can have a loss when the trade expenses are more than the trade income.\nIf the business has a loss for a year prior to signing up to Making Tax Digital, the customer or agent will need to submit details of the loss to be brought forward.\n\nOpen the Losses diagram in a new tab.\nVendors can use the create a brought forward loss endpoint to enable customers to submit the brought forward loss to HMRC.\nWhen the loss detail has been submitted, or if a loss arises for a tax year following sign up to Making Tax Digital, a claim will need to be made to either:\n\n\nutilise the loss against an income source for a specific year, or\nclaim to carry the loss forward so that it is available to use in later years\n\nThe Loss claims endpoint allows the user to do the following:\n\n\nprovide a list of Loss claims\ncreate a Loss claim against an income source for a specific tax year\nshow the detail of an existing Loss claim\ndelete a previously entered Loss claim\nupdate a previously entered Loss claim\n\nBrought Forward Losses\nThese resources allow software packages to provide a customer’s financial data for their brought forward losses. Here the developer can:\n\n\nprovide a list of brought forward losses\ncreate a new brought forward loss to submit against self-employment, self-employment class 4, UK FHL property, other UK (non-FHL) property, foreign property FHL in the European Economic Area (EEA) or other foreign property\nshow a single brought forward loss\ndelete an existing brought forward loss\nupdate an existing brought forward loss\n\nTo carry-back a loss, the customer should contact HMRC who will be able to apply this manually.\nSubmit information about personal income\nSelf-assessment return\nThe software should prompt customers to make sure they have considered the following potential additional income sources (there are links to the APIs where the functionality is available, we will continue to release additional functionality and update this page).\n\n\nany income from bank or building society interest (supported in live)\nany income from dividends (supported in live)\n  any gift aid contributions they have made (supported in live)\n  any pension contributions\n  any pension income\n  capital gains\n  income from employment\n  additional information (currently provided on the SA101)\n  any income from partnerships\n  any income from trusts\n  any foreign income\n\nNote:\nInformation currently provided through the existing self-assessment process: if a customer needs to report information to HMRC that is not yet supported under MTD or your software, they will need to complete a Self Assessment tax return.  Any information they have provided through MTD will not be considered and they will have to submit everything through the existing HMRC Self Assessment service.\nFinal Declaration\nThe software will have to let HMRC know that the customer is ready to submit a final declaration, to do this you must call the Trigger A Self Assessment Tax Calculation endpoint under the Individual Calculations (MTD) API with the finalDeclaration parameter set to true. This will start the final declaration process in HMRC. It will trigger the business validation rules (which will become errors rather than warnings) and generate a final liability calculation.\nThe response includes a calculationId. The software will then have to retrieve the calculation using the calculationId to get the calculation output.\nThe Calculation ID output provides a summary of each income source (for example self-employment, UK property, foreign property and UK bank and building society interest), plus a breakdown of allowances and reliefs applied, and a breakdown of the Income Tax and NIC payable - broadly the equivalent of the current SA302.\nAs of v3.0, the results of the final declaration calculation are available at a single endpoint:\n\n\nRetrieve A Self Assessment Tax Calculation\n\nA final declaration Calculation ID will not always have a calculation result. It is possible that errors in previously submitted income data can prevent a calculation from being performed.\nIf calculation errors are present, these errors are returned in the response to the Retrieve a Self Assessment Tax Calculation endpoint.\n\nOpen the final declaration process diagram in a new tab.\n\n\n Customer is ready to complete their final tax return.\n The software calls the Trigger A Self Assessment Tax Calculation endpoint with finalDeclaration as true – this triggers the creation of the final declaration calculation for the customer to agree.\n HMRC receives the request and starts the tax calculation and returns a Calculation ID.\n The software receives the calculationId.\n Generates the final declaration tax calculation - this process will also convert any business validation warnings into errors, if there are any errors the calculation will not run and the customer will not be able to declare the liability.\n HMRC Stores tax calculation with calculationId.\n The software uses the Submit a Self Assessment Final Declaration to agree to the final declaration.\n\nWe suggest that you retrieve the self-assessment metadata first to check there are no validation errors.  If there are errors the calculation will not have been generated. The customer must go back and amend the digital records, software should resubmit the revised summary totals for the relevant periods, then call the Trigger A Self Assessment Tax Calculation endpoint again.\n\n\n HMRC provides the calculation response.\n Software surfaces the calculation to the customer – at this point in the journey, it is mandatory that the customer is shown a copy of the calculation resulting from the intent to final declaration calculationId. As a minimum a customer must view the equivalent of what is currently in the SA302.\nThe customer reviews the calculation and declaration text.\nThe customer confirms the declaration and the software calls the Crystallisation endpoint using the Calculation ID to confirm the calculation to which the customer is agreeing.\nHMRC receives the submission and confirms receipt with a success message and marks the obligation as fulfilled.\nThe software receives a success message and confirms that HMRC has received the return.\nThe customer views confirmation that the return has been successfully submitted to HMRC.\n\nThe software must use the final declaration calculationId to retrieve the final calculation and display that calculation to the customer. The customer must review this calculation and confirm it is complete and correct by sending the declaration.\nIf the customer thinks the calculation is incorrect as a result of the data they have submitted, they can go back and change the information, by resubmitting the relevant update with the correct information. Once they have done this the software will have to call the Trigger endpoint again to generate a new final liability.\nIf the customer does not agree with the calculation based on rules HMRC have used, then they will still need to declare against this calculation and follow the existing process to challenge the calculation. If a software vendor identifies what they feel could be a technical issue with the Tax calculation API, they will need to contact the SDS Team immediately.\nOnce a customer is confident with all the information, they will have to agree to a declaration and send it to HMRC.\n\n\nThe Declaration\n“Before you can submit the information displayed here in response to your notice to file from HM Revenue \u0026 Customs, you must read and agree to the following statement by\n[Here the vendor can decide how to manage the actual declaration in the user interface, for example a tick box, confirm button or other method]\nI declare that the information and self-assessment I have filed are (taken together) correct and complete to the best of my knowledge. I understand that I may have to pay financial penalties and face prosecution if I give false information.”\nDeclaration for Agents\n“I confirm that my client has received a copy of all the information being filed and approved the information as being correct and complete to the best of their knowledge and belief. My client understands that they may have to pay financial penalties and face prosecution if they give false information.”\n\nThe software must send the calculationId that matches the calculation the customer is declaring against with the declaration.\nMaking an amendment after final declaration\nIf a customer wants to make any changes following a final declaration they have 12 months from the statutory filing date to do this (the statutory filing date is 31 January following the end of the tax year, or 3 months from receipt of a Notice to File by the taxpayer whichever is the later).\nNote: any changes made following final declaration will be a formal amendment under section 9ZA TMA 1970\nPay or get a repayment\nVendors should present messages to business users at key points in their user journey that gives them the option to make payments ahead of any obligation date to help spread the cost. We will deliver functionality that allows vendors to make users aware of payment dates.\nThere are multiple ways to make a payment for Self Assessment which can be found on GOV.UK at:\nhttps://www.gov.uk/pay-self-assessment-tax-bill\nVendors should, in their messaging, ask customers to visit that link so the customer can make a payment in the method that suits them.\nThe contents of this GOV.UK page will be updated and subject to change.\nFor a business to view the previous payments it has made to HMRC, vendors should present messages at key points in their journey that encourage them to visit their Business Tax Account at:\nhttps://www.access.service.gov.uk/login/signin/creds\nVendors in their messaging should ask customers to visit that link.\nCustomers can pay their tax bills by direct debit, making it easy and convenient to pay.\nHMRC is delivering functionality for customers to set up direct debit instructions to pay tax when it becomes due.

The deadline for meeting a quarterly obligation is one month after the obligation period end date. The software should present these deadlines clearly to the customer and prompt them to submit information when the update is due. Submissions of summary-level information cannot span an obligation period. If it does, the software will need to send two updates that fall into different obligations.\nThe software package will need to convert the transactional information into summary totals for each category, for example, expenses by category.\nHMRC has provided APIs to enable the software to be able to send the summary information to HMRC for each income source and allow HMRC to provide a calculation based on all the information we have received to date.\nWhen the update is received, HMRC checks if the customer is signed up to MTD, if the submission is coming from an agent and if that agent is subscribed to agent services and authorised to act on behalf of the client if not, an error is returned.\nNote: If you still get the error and the client insists they have met all of the scenarios, check they have used the correct Government Gateway credentials when granting access to the software.\n\n\nList Self-Employment Period Summaries\nCreate a Self-Employment Period Summary\nRetrieve a Self-Employment Period Summary\nAmend a Self-Employment Period Summary\n\nThe service will include a number of business validation rules to ensure that all submissions are cross-validated before being accepted.

To avoid getting an error, wait at least 5 seconds before retrieving the calculation. \nIt is possible to return both in-year and final declaration calculations using these endpoints. An in-year calculation is worked out if the calculation was triggered by the Trigger a Self Assessment Tax Calculation endpoint\n\nMaking changes to previously submitted data\nIf a customer wants to make a change to the data that was included in a previously submitted update, customers should make the changes to the digital records and software to recalculate the summary totals and submit to HMRC using the following endpoints:\nFor income and expense updates (quarterly)\nIf a customer makes a change to a previously submitted periodic update, we suggest you call the following:\n\n\nList Self-Employment Period Summaries\nList Historic Non-FHL UK Property Income \u0026 Expenses Period Summaries or List Historic FHL UK property Income \u0026 Expenses Period Summaries (depending on business income type) to get the period ID and check the update period date range, to ensure any changes are made to the exact date range otherwise it will be rejected.\n\nThe software will have to recreate the update period including the new summary totals and resubmit the specific update period, using the following:\n\n\nAmend a Self-Employment Period Summary\nAmend a Historic Non-FHL UK Property Income \u0026 Expenses Period Summary or Amend a Historic FHL UK Property Income \u0026 Expenses Period Summary depending on the business income type.\n\nWhen a business resubmits an update period, the software will have to use the trigger a calculation endpoint and follow the same process as the submitting an update period process.\nFor allowance and adjustment updates (annual)\nUse the same endpoints and process for submitting annual information as mentioned.\n\n\nCreate and Amend Self-Employment Annual Submission\nCreate and Amend a Historic Non-FHL UK Property Business Annual Submission\nCreate and Amend a Historic FHL UK Property Business Annual Submission\n\nNote: where a business resubmits an annual summary update, previous figures that have been submitted must be sent again as well as any additional information.

An EOPS must be completed for each source of business income the taxpayer has (just as the current Income Tax process for the SA103, SA105 and SA106 schedules) so, for example, if a customer has one self-employment business and one property business they will have to complete two EOPS.\nEOPS relates to the accounting period or basis period for each source of business income and cannot be completed before the end of that period. Customers can complete their EOPS at any point after the end of the accounting period and do not have to wait until the 31 January deadline. We would like to encourage this behaviour where possible as it helps customers manage their business income in line with the business accounts. However, the deadline to complete is 31 January, Year 2.\nThe process will take into account all the periodic and annual data already provided by the customer throughout the year.\nCustomers must make sure they are confident with the information they have provided and add any additional information they have. This is likely to include tax and accounting adjustments, allowances or reliefs.\n\nOpen the EOPS diagram in a new tab.\n\n\nThe customer inputs information about allowances and adjustments for the business\nincome source. They can provide this information throughout the year, but must do it\nbefore they complete the EOPS.\nThe software calls the Retrieve a Self-Employment Annual Submission, Retrieve a Historic Non-FHL UK Property Business Annual Submission\nor Retrieve a Historic FHL UK Property Business Annual Submission, depending on the business income type you need to submit. This step is optional, but we recommend it to ensure you are getting the most up-to-date information.\nThe customer views the allowances and adjustment information and updates relevant information.\nThe software submits information using the Create and Amend Self-Employment Annual Submission,\nCreate and Amend a Historic Non-FHL UK Property Business Annual Submission or Create and Amend a Historic FHL UK Property Business Annual Submission. Depending on the business income type you need to update.\nHMRC receives and stores information\nThe software calls the Trigger a Self Assessment Tax Calculation endpoint to get the calculation\nHMRC receives the request and returns a Calculation ID (calculationId) software must\nuse this when calling the Self Assessment Tax Calculation endpoints.\nThe software receives the calculationId. Note: you could display the calculation to customers at\nthis point if you choose, if you do follow steps 20 and 21 in the periodic update section.\nThe customer wants to make some accounting adjustments following the business accounts\nbeing finalised.\nThe software calls the SA Accounting summary API (currently in development).\nHMRC returns summary totals of all the information for that business income source.\nThe software displays information to the customer.\nThe customer makes adjustments, confirms and submits.\nThe software sends information to HMRC using the SA Accounting summary API (currently in\ndevelopment).\nHMRC confirms receipt and stores the information.\nThe software calls the Retrieve a Self Assessment Tax Calculation endpoint to retrieve the calculation. Note: the Tax\nCalculation can take up to 5 seconds to run, so we recommend the software waits 5 seconds – this is optional, the software does not have to retrieve the tax calculation information at this point.\nThe software displays the calculation to the user – this is optional software does not have to show the calculation to the customer at this point.\nThe customer is ready to finalise their business income source.\nThe software calls the Retrieve a Business Income Source Summary (BISS) endpoint. Note: there is one BISS for each property type and it will show either FHL or non-FHL information in it. Calling the BISS API is optional, the software may choose to create a BISS themselves, but the information must be shown to the customer before they confirm the declaration.\nThe software displays BISS (Business Income Source Summary) information to the customer (listed below).\n\n\nThis can be totalled up by software, or through the APIs from HMRC systems as well as BISS for self-employment or property:\nTotal Business Income\nTotal Expenses\nBusiness Net Profit\nBusiness Net Loss\nTotal Additions to net profit or deductions to a net loss\nTotal Deductions to net profit or additions to a net loss\nAccounting Adjustments\nTaxable Profit\nTaxable Loss\nThis information must be shown to the customer for them to confirm it is complete and correct for that source of business income before they send the declaration.\nYou could use the BISS API or opt to create this information within your package. HMRC will need the declaration to confirm the customer has seen it.\n\nCustomer reviews and confirms the information.\nThe software uses Submit End of Period Statement for a Business endpoint depending on the income source you are finalising.\nHMRC receives the declaration and marks the obligation as met and provides a success response.\nThe software receives the success response.\nThe software confirms with the customer that the update has been received and stored by\nHMRC.\n\nNote:   data received must cover the whole accounting period.\nThe declaration is the only mandatory requirement for this process, the exact text that HMRC requires you to present is below.\nDevelopers must replace ‘[insert tax year]’ with the correct tax year.\nDeclaration for Agents\n\n\nDeclaration for Self Employment EOPS\n“I confirm that my client has reviewed the information provided to establish the taxable profits for the relevant period ending in [insert tax year] together with the designatory data provided for that period and that it is correct and complete to the best of their knowledge. They understand that they may have to pay financial penalties or face prosecution if they give false information.”\nDeclaration for Property EOPS\n“I confirm that my client has reviewed the information provided to establish taxable profits for the relevant period ending in [insert tax year] together with the designatory data for that period and that it is correct and complete to the best of their knowledge. They understand that they may have to pay financial penalties or face prosecution if they give false information.”\n\nDeclaration for Individuals\n\n\nDeclaration for Self Employment EOPS\n“I confirm that I have reviewed the information provided to establish the taxable profits for the relevant period ending in [insert tax year] together with the designatory data provided for that period and that it is correct and complete to the best of my knowledge. I understand that I may have to pay financial penalties or face prosecution if I give false information.”\nDeclaration for Property EOPS\n“I confirm that I have reviewed the information provided to establish taxable profits for the relevant period ending in [insert tax year] together with the designatory data for that period and that it is correct and complete to the best of my knowledge. I understand that I may have to pay financial penalties or face prosecution if I give false information.”\n\nMaking changes to previously submitted data during and after an EOPS declaration:\n\n\nif the information the customer has previously provided relating to that source of business income is not correct or complete (for example the previous information provided fails further validation, or a periodic update is missing), then the EOPS declaration is rejected, and error messages are returned. The changes must be made to any relevant periodic or annual summaries and then follow the existing process of submitting updates and triggering the calculation before attempting the declaration again.\nif there are no error failures, it is recommended that customers review any warning messages they have at this point or earlier as warnings will cause a failure at final declaration.\nif after the customer has completed their EOPS declaration, they need to revise any of the data relating to that source of business income then they must make the change to the relevant periodic or annual summaries and follow the existing process of submitting updates and triggering the calculation.\n\nNote: making changes to data for previously submitted periods is covered in the “making changes to previously submitted data” section.\nView previously submitted updates\nA customer may want to retrieve previously submitted data, for example before making a change the customer may want to request the last update provided before sending in any changes. If the customer has recently started using your software, you may need to retrieve previous data.\nIncome and expense updates (Periodic)\nThe software can use the list all self-employment or property update periods endpoints to retrieve the list of updates made for that income source, or to find one or more period IDs. The period ID is then used with the ‘get a self-employment/property (FHL or Non FHL) periodic update’ endpoint to retrieve data for that update.\nAnnual accounting adjustments\nWithin the annual self-assessment process, annual accounting adjustments are applied to income and expenses before the business or agent submits their tax return to HMRC. Within Making Tax Digital as the income and expenses are submitted to HMRC at least quarterly\nduring the active accounting period, this means a new process to accommodate these adjustments is required.\nSubmitting annual accounting adjustments\nAfter an accounting period has ended, a business or agent may need to submit accounting adjustments to the income and expenses that have been submitted throughout the year.\nEndpoints to call are:\n\n\nTrigger a Business Source Adjustable Summary.\nRetrieve a Self-employment Business Source Adjustable Summary (BSAS), Retrieve a UK Property Business Source Adjustable Summary (BSAS) or Retrieve a Foreign Property Business Source Adjustable Summary (BSAS) - these endpoints provide the totals of all income and expenses submitted for a business that can have adjustments applied to them.\nApply the adjustments as appropriate to the total figures returned via the Retrieve BSAS endpoints.\nSubmit Self-Employment Accounting Adjustments, Submit UK Property Accounting Adjustments or Submit Foreign Property Accounting Adjustments.\n\nOnce submitted, if a further amendment is required, use the Retrieve a Self-Employment Business Source Adjustable Summary (BSAS), Retrieve a UK Property Business Source Adjustable Summary (BSAS) or Retrieve a Foreign Property Business Source Adjustable Summary (BSAS) endpoints to retrieve the previously submitted data and then repeat steps 3 and 4.\nBusiness Income Source Summary\nThe Self Assessment BISS (Business Income Source Summary) API allows a developer to retrieve a summary of income and expenditure that has been submitted for a specified self-employment or property business (UK or foreign) for a given tax year. The data returned is the equivalent of the existing SA103, SA105 and SA106 schedule.\n\nOpen the BISS diagram in a new tab.\n\n\nRetrieve a Business Income Source Summary (BISS)\n\nBusiness Source Adjustable Summary\nThe Self Assessment BSAS (Business Source Adjustable Summary) API allows a developer to retrieve an adjustable summary calculation for a specified self-employment or property business, for a given accounting period.\nThis API should be used to submit any Annual Accounting Adjustments. The adjustments should be submitted as positive or negative amounts, for example, if advertising costs in the BSAS is £250 but the figure should be £200, then the adjustment required would be -50.\nNote: Adjustments are always made against the total of the original quarterly updates. Each new adjustment will overwrite the previous adjustment.\n\n        \n          \n\nOriginal (total of all 4 quarters)\n1st adjustment\nRevised total\n2nd adjustment\nRevised total\n\npremisesRunningCosts\n500\n25\n525\n23\n523\n\ntravelCosts\n600\n-17\n583\n-17\n583\n\n        \n      \nOpen the BSAS diagram in a new tab.\n\n\nList Business Source Adjustable Summaries\nTrigger a Business Source Adjustable Summary\nRetrieve a Self-Employment Business Source Adjustable Summary (BSAS)\nSubmit Self-Employment Accounting Adjustments\nRetrieve a UK Property Business Source Adjustable Summary (BSAS)\nSubmit UK Property Accounting Adjustments\nRetrieve a Foreign Property Business Source Adjustable Summary (BSAS)\nSubmit Foreign Property Accounting Adjustments\n\nMultiple businesses\nUsers with multiple self-employment businesses and those with a foreign property business will be able to sign up to Making Tax Digital. To enable this we are providing a number of new endpoints:\n\n\nList All Businesses - returns a list of the business income sources\nRetrieve Business Details - returns further information about a single business income source\nRetrieve Income Tax (Self Assessment) Income and Expenditure Obligations - returns the quarterly obligations for each business income source\nRetrieve Income Tax (Self Assessment) End of Period Statement Obligations - returns the End of Period Statement obligations for a user’s business income sources\nRetrieve Income Tax (Self Assessment) Final Declaration Obligations - returns the final declaration obligation for a user\nAmend Loss Claims Order - permits a change in the order in which loss claims are consumed\n\n\nOpen the list all businesses diagram in a new tab.\nProperty unspecified in the Gov test scenario means where we are unable to identify the type of property business - whether UK or foreign. In exceptional cases, we return a type of “property-unspecified”.\nIn the case where the query is made with a validly formed but incorrect National Insurance number for a user a “not found” can be returned.\n Open the retrieve details businesses diagram in a new tab.\n Open the retrieve Income Tax (Self Assessment) income and expenditure diagram in a new tab.\nIn the case where the query is made with a validly formed but incorrect National Insurance number for a user a “not found” can be returned.\n\nOpen the retrieve Income Tax (Self Assessment) End of Period Statement obligations diagram in a new tab.\n\nOpen the retrieve Income Tax (Self Assessment) final declaration obligations diagram in a new tab.\nThe List Loss Claims endpoint has been extended to include a sequence number that shows the order in which loss claims will be used.\nA user with multiple businesses may choose to list their businesses so that they can obtain the Business IDs of their active businesses. A developer can then return information about a specific business or retrieve obligations quoting a businessID, so the user knows when they need to submit information.\nWhere more than one business income source has incurred a loss at the end of the tax year and the user has opted to carry-sideways these losses (by listing loss claims) they will see the current order in which these loss claims will be applied.  If they wish to change the order they can amend the loss claim order preference and list loss claims to review.\nNot all loss claims will have a sequence number to indicate the order of use (currently only carry-sideways, future functionality will enable you to carry backwards). When changing the order, all the loss claims of the same type (for example carry-sideways) must be included in the submission.\nTo obtain the businessID a developer will need to call the List All businesses endpoint.  This will then permit obligations to be retrieved for a particular Business ID so that the user is clear by when they must submit their business data.\nOnce loss claims have been generated a user will be able to list them and determine if the order in which they are used needs to change.\n","url":"/documentation/businessandpropertyincome.html"},"97":{"title":"Alphabetical List of

Assist | Income Tax (MTD) End-to-End Service Guide","content":"HMRC Assist\n\n\nOverview\nAs part of Making Tax Digital, HMRC Assist is a set of APIs that will create a better customer experience by prompting customers with help via software when they request their end of year tax calculation before finalising their return.\nHMRC Assist is a new digital service for customers who are signed up for Making Tax Digital ITSA. It will provide targeted and tailored messaging to support individual customers with their tax affairs. Agents acting on behalf of clients will receive the same service when they request a tax calculation.\nThe service will encourage customers to submit accurate information using personalised real-time guidance, increasing correct first-time submissions and compliance.\nThe service will take the calculation data of the customer, analyse the submission and generate a series of guidance material, links and suggested actions for the customer to review.\nHMRC Assist will be integrated into HMRC’s ITSA Submission Service so that customers completing their final declaration or return amendment using HMRC online services will receive tailored assistance.\nHigh-level HMRC Assist customer journey\n\nOpen the high-level diagram in a new tab.\nHMRC Assist endpoints\nThere are two endpoints:\n\n\nProduce a HMRC Self Assessment Assist Report - this endpoint enables you to generate and return a HMRC Self Assessment Assist report for a tax calculation for a given customer.\nAcknowledge a HMRC Self Assessment Assist Report - this endpoint enables you to acknowledge that the customer or agent has read the report.\n\nProduce a HMRC Self Assessment Assist Report\nThe report contains targeted feedback based on what the customer advises HMRC in their update for the given National Insurance number (NINO), Calculation ID, and tax year.\n\nOpen the produce a report diagram in a new tab.\nA HTTP 200 success code is returned and the targeted message, recommended action and guidance links are within the JSON for the software to display.\nAcknowledge a HMRC Self Assessment Assist Report\nThis endpoint enables you to acknowledge that the given report has been read by either the customer or agent.\n\nOpen the Acknowledge HMRC Assist report diagram in a new tab.\nTo acknowledge the report, a HTTP 204 code is returned and contains no content.\n","url":"/documentation/hmrc-assist.html"},"99":{"title":"Close down | ITSA (MTD) End-to-End Service Guide","content":"Opting out of MTD\nCustomers who are in MTD on a voluntary basis can leave (opt out) at any time. When this happens the customer’s filing obligations will change from MTD (quarterly) to a single annual obligation due on 31 January following the end of the tax year - this is their final declaration.\nEligibility to opt out is determined on a tax year basis. For example, a customer can be mandated for the current year and voluntary for the next year, meaning the customer could opt out next year. A customer can opt out for the previous tax year if they signed up to MTD as a voluntary customer, then subsequently decided not to submit quarterly - opting out would allow the customer to file on an annual basis for that year.\nThe opt out service will not be available through an API.\n\n\nCustomers can access the opt out service and see their changed obligations immediately from their HMRC online services account.\nAgents will use their Agent Services Account to access their client’s account. Changed obligations will also be viewable immediately in their software.\n\nIf the customer has submitted updates of business income and expenses (self-employment and/or property) through their software for the tax year they opt out of MTD, these updates will be deleted. The customer or their agent will receive a warning message to inform them that this is going to happen. The total business income and expenses (for the tax year) must then be submitted as part of the customer’s tax return before completing their final declaration.\nIf a customer is mandated to be in MTD, they will not be eligible to opt out. The opt out service will only be available in HMRC online services for eligible customers.\n","url":"/documentation/closedown.html"},"100":{"title":"Marriage Allowance | Income Tax (MTD) End-to-End Service Guide","content":"Marriage Allowance\nMarriage Allowance allows the user to transfer £1,260 of their Personal Allowance to their husband, wife or civil partner.\nThis reduces the recipient’s tax by up to £252 in the tax year (6 April to 5 April the next year).\nTo create a Marriage Allowance claim the recipients name, date of birth and NINO must be provided.\nUse the Create Marriage Allowance endpoint in the Individuals Disclosures API.\n","url":"/documentation/marriage-allowance.html"},"101":{"title":"Construction Industry Scheme","content":"Construction Industry Scheme\nThese endpoints allow a subcontractor working within the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS) to retrieve, submit, override and delete the gross income, cost of materials and tax deducted amounts if they disagree with the amounts submitted on their behalf by the contractors they have worked for during the tax year. The tax deducted monthly by the contractor will be credited to the subcontractor within their tax calculation during the tax year.\nWhen the user sends their quarterly update and retrieves a tax calculation this will include the tax deducted by the contractor, the user may want to call these endpoints to query or check the data supplied by the contractor.\nWhen the user does not agree with the data the contractor has reported to HMRC, the user can submit what they believe to be the correct amounts, or if no data from the contractor is included in the calculation, the user may want to submit the details so that they can be given credit for the tax the contractor has deducted on their behalf. This can only be supplied after the end of the tax year.\nDuring the year, the user should also query this with the contractor as they may need to amend the monthly return they make to HMRC, or query with the contractor why monthly returns are not being made to HMRC.\nIf the user has submitted data after the end of the year because no data was supplied by the contractor or they did not agree with the data the contractor has reported to HMRC but the user later realises the data they submitted is incorrect, they can simply delete the data using the delete endpoint.\nIf any data the user has submitted is different from the records HMRC hold the user data is accepted. Any discrepancies will be flagged by the system for a HMRC review.\nCreate CIS Deductions for Subcontractor - this endpoint allows a user to create a customer override to the CIS deductions which have been previously populated by data submitted directly to HMRC by the contractor, or create CIS deductions if no data has been submitted to HMRC by the Contractor.
