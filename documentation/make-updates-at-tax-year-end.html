<h2 id="additional-information">Additional information</h2>

<p>If Making Tax Digital (MTD) customers are earning any type of income in addition to their self-employment and property income, they must report that to HMRC just as they would in their Self Assessment return.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Currently, the endpoints for reporting additional income through software are included in the 
    <a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/">Individuals Income Received API</a>. As of June 2024, the Individuals Income Received API will be deprecated and replaced with the following new APIs:</p><ul> 
    <li><a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-employments-income-api/">Individuals Employments Income API</a></li>
    <li><a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-dividends-income-api/">Individuals Dividends Income API</a></li>
    <li><a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-foreign-income-api/">Individuals Foreign Income API</a></li>

    <li><a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-capital-gains-income-api/">Individuals Capital Gains Income API</a></li></ul>
<p>These new APIs are now available for testing in Sandbox.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your software should prompt customers to provide details about any additional income sources. If the software does not support submission of any applicable additional income, customers must use <a href="/guides/income-tax-mtd-end-to-end-service-guide/documentation/tasks-outside-mtd-software.html#hmrc-online-services" rel="noopener noreferrer">HMRC online services</a> to make their submission. For more information about which type of income to tell HMRC, refer to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-additional-income-tax" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check if you need to tell HMRC about additional income (GOV.UK)</a>.</p>
<p>Customers who need to submit their additional income must do it before submitting their final declaration. The following sections cover the different types of additional income and the endpoints needed to submit them in the software.</p>
<h3 id="construction-industry-scheme">Construction Industry Scheme</h3>

<p>Under the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS), <a href="https://www.gov.uk/what-you-must-do-as-a-cis-contractor" rel="noopener noreferrer">contractors</a> deduct money from a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/what-you-must-do-as-a-cis-subcontractor" rel="noopener noreferrer">subcontractor&rsquo;s</a> payments and send it to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).</p>
<p>Currently, under Self Assessment, a subcontractor submits their deductions on their Self Assessment return and it is checked against HMRC records with what their contractor(s) have submitted.</p>
<p>Under Making Tax Digital for ITSA, a customer can view what has been submitted by their contractor through their <a href="/guides/income-tax-mtd-end-to-end-service-guide/documentation/tasks-outside-mtd-software.html#hmrc-online-services" rel="noopener noreferrer">HMRC online services</a> account or their software. Customers can complete the following tasks on their CIS deductions:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#view-cis-deductions" rel="noopener noreferrer">view CIS deductions</a></li>
<li><a href="#create-cis-deductions" rel="noopener noreferrer">create CIS deductions</a></li>
<li><a href="#amend-cis-deductions" rel="noopener noreferrer">amend CIS deductions</a></li>
<li><a href="#delete-cis-deductions" rel="noopener noreferrer">delete CIS deductions</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="view-cis-deductions">View CIS deductions</h4>

<p>A customer, at any time, can view a breakdown of all the CIS deductions that have been reported to HMRC by their contractors. In software, this is done by calling the <a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/cis-deductions-api/2.0/oas/page#/paths/~1individuals~1deductions~1cis~1%7Bnino%7D~1current-position~1%7BtaxYear%7D~1%7Bsource%7D/get" rel="noopener noreferrer">Retrieve CIS Deductions for Subcontractor</a> endpoint.</p>
<p><a href="/documentation/figures/cis-retrieve-cis.svg" target="blank"><img src="/documentation/figures/cis-retrieve-cis.svg" alt="CIS create diagram" style="width:720px;" /></a>
<a href="/documentation/figures/cis-retrieve-cis.svg" target="blank">Open the CIS retrieve deduction diagram in a new tab</a>.</p>
<p>When the customer submits quarterly updates to HMRC through their software, they will not be required to provide a CIS deduction amount. When a quarterly update has been made, the software will trigger the tax calculation using the <a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individual-calculations-api/5.0/oas/page#tag/Tax-Calculations/paths/~1individuals~1calculations~1%7Bnino%7D~1self-assessment~1%7BtaxYear%7D/post" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trigger a Self Assessment Tax Calculation</a> endpoint and display the calculation result to the customer using the <a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individual-calculations-api/5.0/oas/page#tag/Tax-Calculations/paths/~1individuals~1calculations~1%7Bnino%7D~1self-assessment~1%7BtaxYear%7D~1%7BcalculationId%7D/get" rel="noopener noreferrer">Retrieve A Self Assessment Tax Calculation</a> endpoint. This calculation result will include the CIS deductions received by the contractor for that quarter.</p>
<p>If the customer does not agree with the amount the contractor has submitted to HMRC for any of their quarterly updates, HMRC advises them to query any discrepancies with their contractor.</p>
<h4 id="create-cis-deductions">Create CIS deductions</h4>

<p>At the end of the year, if the customer still does not agree with the CIS deductions amount the contractor has submitted to HMRC, they can submit what they believe to be the correct amount. This needs to be completed following the fourth quarterly update and before the end-of-period statement is submitted. In software, this is done by calling the <a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/cis-deductions-api/2.0/oas/page#/paths/~1individuals~1deductions~1cis~1%7Bnino%7D~1amendments/post" rel="noopener noreferrer">Create CIS Deductions for Subcontractor</a> endpoint. After successfully creating CIS deductions for the customer, the API returns a submission ID in the success response. This ID must be used to amend or delete CIS deductions in the future. A customer might also submit their CIS deductions amount if they find that no data from the contractor is included in the tax calculation.</p>
<p><a href="/documentation/figures/cis-create-cis.svg" target="blank"><img src="/documentation/figures/cis-create-cis.svg" alt="CIS create diagram" style="width:720px;" /></a>
<a href="/documentation/figures/cis-create-cis.svg" target="blank">Open the CIS create deduction diagram in a new tab</a></p>
<h4 id="amend-cis-deductions">Amend CIS deductions</h4>

<p>If the customer has submitted a CIS deduction amount after the end of the year but later realises what they submitted was incorrect, they can provide the correct CIS deduction amount. This amendment can be made even after the end-of-period statement is submitted. However, it needs to be done before the final declaration is submitted. In software, amending CIS deductions is done by calling the <a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/cis-deductions-api/2.0/oas/page#/paths/~1individuals~1deductions~1cis~1%7Bnino%7D~1amendments~1%7BsubmissionId%7D/put" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amend CIS Deductions for Subcontractor</a> endpoint.</p>
<p><a href="/documentation/figures/cis-amend-cis.svg" target="blank"><img src="/documentation/figures/cis-amend-cis.svg" alt="CIS amend diagram" style="width:720px;" /></a>
<a href="/documentation/figures/cis-amend-cis.svg" target="blank">Open the CIS amend deduction diagram in a new tab</a></p>
<h4 id="delete-cis-deductions">Delete CIS deductions</h4>

<p>If the customer has submitted a CIS deduction amount after the end of the year but later realises they did not pay any CIS deductions and what they submitted was incorrect, they can delete the amount. This deletion can be made even after the end-of-period statement is submitted. However, it needs to be done before the final declaration is submitted. In software, deleting CIS deductions is done by calling the <a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/cis-deductions-api/2.0/oas/page#/paths/~1individuals~1deductions~1cis~1%7Bnino%7D~1amendments~1%7BsubmissionId%7D/delete" rel="noopener noreferrer">Delete CIS Deductions for Subcontractor</a> endpoint.</p>
<p><a href="/documentation/figures/cis-delete-cis.svg" target="blank"><img src="/documentation/figures/cis-delete-cis.svg" alt="CIS delete diagram" style="width:720px;" /></a>
<a href="/documentation/figures/cis-delete-cis.svg" target="blank">Open the CIS delete deduction diagram in a new tab</a></p>
<h3 id="employment-income">Employment income</h3>

<p>A customer will have employment income if they work for an employer who deducts tax from their pay through Pay As You Earn (PAYE). A customer&rsquo;s earnings and tax deducted are sent to HMRC by their employer. This allows HMRC to hold an employment history for each customer. HMRC uses this information to calculate whether the correct PAYE tax has been paid at the end of the tax year. For more information about declaring employment income, refer to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-employment-sa102" rel="noopener noreferrer">Self Assessment: Employment (GOV.UK).</a></p>
<p>Currently, under Self Assessment, a customer will see their PAYE earnings, tax deducted and other financial details pre-populated in their online tax return. They can overwrite any information that might be incorrect.</p>
<p>Customers can continue to do this under Making Tax Digital (MTD). They can:</p>

<ul>
<li>view employment details (financial and non-financial) held by HMRC throughout the year</li>
<li>create and amend employment details submitted by them after the end of the tax year</li>
<li>delete employment details submitted by them after the end of the tax year</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="view-employment-details">View employment details</h4>

<p>The following endpoints enables the customer to view different types of employment details:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Employments/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1employments~1{nino}~1{taxYear}/get" rel="noopener noreferrer">List Employments</a></li>

<li><a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Other-Employment-Income/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1employments~1other~1{nino}~1{taxYear}/get" rel="noopener noreferrer">Retrieve Other Employment Income</a></li>
<li><a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Employments/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1employments~1{nino}~1{taxYear}~1{employmentId}~1financial-details/get" rel="noopener noreferrer">Retrieve an Employment and its Financial Details</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A customer, at any time, can view a list of their employers for a specific tax year. The <a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Employments/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1employments~1{nino}~1{taxYear}/get" rel="noopener noreferrer">List Employments</a> endpoint provides the software with the Employment IDs for each customer employment. This Employment ID is necessary to call other employment income endpoints.</p>
<p>The software can use the <a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Employments/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1employments~1{nino}~1{taxYear}~1{employmentId}/get" rel="noopener noreferrer">Retrieve an Employment</a> endpoint to enable the customer to view non-financial details about a specific employment for a given tax year. This includes the start date of the employment and employer name.</p>
<p>The software can use the <a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Other-Employment-Income/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1employments~1other~1{nino}~1{taxYear}/get" rel="noopener noreferrer">Retrieve Other Employment Income</a> endpoint to enable the customer to view other employment income details for a given year. This includes share options, shares awarded or received, disability, lump sums and foreign service income.</p>
<p>Employers will also submit financial details that form the customers earnings and deductions. In software, this information can be viewed using the <a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Employments/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1employments~1{nino}~1{taxYear}~1{employmentId}~1financial-details/get" rel="noopener noreferrer">Retrieve an Employment and its Financial Details</a> endpoint. The endpoint contains details on taxable pay to date, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-company-benefits" rel="noopener noreferrer">benefits in kind</a>, student loan deductions and the customer&rsquo;s off payroll working status for a specific employment.</p>
<h4 id="off-payroll-working-opw-rules">Off-payroll working (OPW) rules</h4>

<p>Off-payroll working rules (IR35) govern how a worker (sometimes called a contractor) who is providing their services through an intermediary such as a personal service company, is treated in terms of their Income Tax and National Insurance.

<p>The off-payroll worker status can be seen in-year as part of the employment pre-population into the customer’s self-assessment tax calculations. In software, the off-payroll working status is retrieved using the <a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Employments/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1employments~1%7Bnino%7D~1%7BtaxYear%7D~1%7BemploymentId%7D~1financial-details/get" rel="noopener noreferrer">Retrieve an Employment and its Financial Details</a> endpoint.

If the status is set to false, indicating the worker is not regarded as being subject to OPW rules, the software should not display it to the customer. This status is view-only: the customer does not need to take any action unless they think it has been set in error, in which case they must contact their employer.</p>
<p>After the end of the tax year, the off-payroll working status will be displayed to the customer along with the employment data fields. As part of their self-assessment, if a customer agrees with their off-payroll working status, there is no further action required from them. However, if a customer disagrees with their off-payroll working status, they can change it after the end of tax year before completing their final declaration. This change can be made in software or through their <a href="/guides/income-tax-mtd-end-to-end-service-guide/documentation/tasks-outside-mtd-software.html#hmrc-online-services" rel="noopener noreferrer">HMRC online services</a> account. The software must call the <a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-income-received-api/2.0/oas/page#tag/Employments/paths/~1individuals~1income-received~1employments~1%7Bnino%7D~1%7BtaxYear%7D~1%7BemploymentId%7D~1financial-details/put" rel="noopener noreferrer">Create and Amend Employment Financial Details</a> endpoint to change the off-payroll working status.</p>
<p>The following  warning message must be displayed to the customer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Do you want to change your employment details? You are about to change information [insert employer name] sent to HMRC:</p>

<ul>
<li>Off-payroll working status</li>
</ul>
<p>HMRC may review this change.”</p>

<h3 id="capital-gains-tax">Capital Gains Tax</h3>

<p>Capital Gains Tax is a tax on the profit when someone sells or disposes of an asset that has increased in value. Customers may need to report on the following types of asset:</p>

<ul>
<li>residential property</li>
<li>other property </li>
<li>listed and unlisted shares and securities </li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about Capital Gains Tax, refer to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/capital-gains-tax" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capital Gains Tax: what you pay it on, rates and allowances (GOV.UK)</a>.</p>
<p>MTD customers can also report any losses they have made. This charge may be set against earlier or later years. When the customer sells or disposes of the whole or part of a UK residential property and is liable to pay Capital Gains Tax, they must tell HMRC within a specific time following the date of completion of the sale. For more information about the reporting requirement, refer to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/report-and-pay-your-capital-gains-tax/if-you-sold-a-property-in-the-uk-on-or-after-6-april-2020" rel="noopener noreferrer">Report and pay your Capital Gains Tax: If you sold a property in the UK on or after 6 April 2020 (GOV.UK)</a>. For non-resident customers, refer to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/capital-gains-tax-for-non-residents-uk-residential-property" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tell HMRC about Capital Gains Tax on UK property or land if you’re not a UK resident (GOV.UK)</a>, which advises on how these gains must be reported in year.</p>
<p>The customer can create, update, or delete their capital gains tax in software only after the end of the tax year.

In some cases, customers must report and pay before they submit their final declaration. However, this information will still need to be included in their final declaration if they are a Self Assessment or MTD customer.</p>
<p>An MTD customer can do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>view Capital Gains Tax Residential Property Disposals for personal property disposal (PPD), non-PPD and other capital gains and disposals</li>
<li>create or amend Capital Gains Tax Residential Property Disposals for PPD, non-PPD and other capital gains and disposals</li>

<h3 id="marriage-allowance">Marriage Allowance</h3>

<p>Marriage Allowance allows the customer to transfer some of their Personal Allowance to their husband, wife or civil partner. This will reduce the customer&rsquo;s tax in the next tax year (6 April to 5 April). For more information about marriage allowance, refer to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/marriage-allowance" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marriage Allowance: How it works - GOV.UK</a>.</p>
<p>Customers can create a Marriage Allowance claim using their name, date of birth and National Insurance number.

<h2 id="submit-accounting-adjustments">Submit accounting adjustments</h2>

<p>When the customer has submitted all quarterly updates, they may need to make an accounting adjustment to their income or expenses. They should first make changes to their digital records and then use the software to submit them to HMRC. The <a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/self-assessment-bsas-api/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Self Assessment BSAS (Business Source Adjustable Summary) API</a> enables a customer to submit or retrieve an adjustable summary calculation for a specified self-employment or property business.</p>
<p>The adjustments should be submitted as a positive or negative amount. For example, if a customer has already submitted advertising costs of £250 but the figure should be £200, the adjustment required would be -50. Adjustments are always made against the total of the original quarterly updates. Each new adjustment will overwrite the previous adjustment as shown in the table below.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-treat-a-loss">How to treat a loss</h2>

<p>A self-employed business can have a loss when trade expenses are more than trade income. If the business has a loss for a year before signing up to Making Tax Digital, the customer or agent will need to submit details about the loss to be brought forward. For more information, refer to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/losses-hs227-self-assessment-helpsheet/hs227-losses-2023#using-losses-types-of-claim" rel="noopener noreferrer">HS227 Losses (GOV.UK).</a></p>
<p>Customers can submit different types of losses through their software. This includes brought forward losses and capital gains losses. Brought forward losses can be calculated for the customer’s self-employment, UK property, and foreign property business income types. The software can use the following endpoints to enable customers to:</p>

<h2 id="final-declaration">Final declaration</h2>

<p>Final declaration is the process that allows customers to finalise their tax position for any one tax year, taking into account all sources of chargeable income and gains, whether business income or otherwise.</p>
<p>It is also the process by which most formal claims for reliefs and allowances and any deductions are made, where these were previously included within a Self Assessment tax return.</p>
<p>Customers are able to tell us at this point (subject to the existing limits) how they wish any losses available to them to be treated.</p>
<p>Customers can make a final declaration from 6 April Year 1. The deadline for final declaration is 31 January Year 2. The software should remind customers to help them to meet this deadline.</p>
<p>Before starting the final declaration journey, the software package must ensure that for the relevant tax year, the customer:</p>

<ul>
<li>has submitted quarterly update information for each business income source (self-employment and property income)</li>
<li>has finalised EOPS for all their businesses (self-employment and property income)</li>
<li>has already provided their entire income (for example, interest, dividends, other SA schedules)</li>
<li>does not have any additional information to provide (for example, information about how to treat a loss)</li>
</ul>
<p>If your software will not allow customers to report their entire income and reliefs, customers should be informed to report them using <a href="/guides/income-tax-mtd-end-to-end-service-guide/documentation/tasks-outside-mtd-software.html#hmrc-online-services" rel="noopener noreferrer">HMRC online services</a>.</p>
<h3 id="making-a-final-declaration">Making a final declaration</h3>

<p>The software will have to let HMRC know that the customer is ready to submit a final declaration. To do this, you must call the <a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individual-calculations-api/5.0/oas/page#tag/Tax-Calculations/paths/~1individuals~1calculations~1%7Bnino%7D~1self-assessment~1%7BtaxYear%7D/post" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trigger a Self Assessment Tax Calculation</a> endpoint under the <a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individual-calculations-api" rel="noopener noreferrer">Individual Calculations (MTD) API</a> with the Final Declaration parameter set to &lsquo;true&rsquo;. This has the following consequences:</p>

<ul>
<li>it starts the final declaration process in HMRC </li>
<li>it triggers the business validation rules (which, if violated, produce errors rather than warnings) </li>
<li>it generates a final liability calculation and a Calculation ID</li>
<li>the software must then quote the Calculation ID when retrieving the calculation output using the <a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individual-calculations-api/5.0/oas/page#tag/Tax-Calculations/paths/~1individuals~1calculations~1%7Bnino%7D~1self-assessment~1%7BtaxYear%7D~1%7BcalculationId%7D/get" rel="noopener noreferrer">Retrieve A Self Assessment Tax Calculation</a> endpoint</li>
</ul>
<p>If the <a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individual-calculations-api/5.0/oas/page#tag/Tax-Calculations/paths/~1individuals~1calculations~1{nino}~1self-assessment~1{taxYear}/post" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trigger a Self Assessment Tax Calculation</a> does not pass HMRC validation, it results in an error. For more information, refer to <a href="/guides/income-tax-mtd-end-to-end-service-guide/documentation/tax-calculations.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tax calculations</a>. If it results in no errors, the results of the final declaration calculation are available to the software to show the customer.</p>
<p>If a customer thinks the calculation is incorrect based on the data they have submitted, they can go back and change the information by resubmitting the relevant update with the correct information. After they have done this, the software will have to call the <a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individual-calculations-api/5.0/oas/page#tag/Tax-Calculations/paths/~1individuals~1calculations~1%7Bnino%7D~1self-assessment~1%7BtaxYear%7D/post" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trigger a Self Assessment Tax Calculation</a> endpoint again to generate a new final liability.</p>
<p>If a customer does not agree with the calculation based on rules HMRC has used, they will need to contact HMRC before submitting their final declaration. If a software provider identifies a problem with the <a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individual-calculations-api" rel="noopener noreferrer">Individual Calculations API</a>, they will need to contact <a href="mailto:SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk" rel="noopener noreferrer">SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> After a customer has submitted their final declaration, they will not currently be able to amend their submission using their software.</p>
<h4 id="agreeing-to-the-declaration">Agreeing to the declaration</h4>

<p>After a customer is confident that they have submitted all the required income tax information through software and <a href="/guides/income-tax-mtd-end-to-end-service-guide/documentation/tasks-outside-mtd-software.html#hmrc-online-services" rel="noopener noreferrer">HMRC online services</a>, they will have to agree to a declaration and send it to HMRC.

</ol>
<h2 id="making-amendments-after-submitting-a-final-declaration">Making amendments after submitting a final declaration</h2>

<p>If a customer wants to make any changes following a final declaration, they have 12 months from the statutory filing date to do this (the statutory filing date is 31 January following the end of the tax year). They can make these changes by following the existing <a href="https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-tax-returns/corrections" rel="noopener noreferrer">Self Assessment tax returns amendment process</a>. These amendments cannot currently be made using software.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Any changes made after final declaration will be a formal amendment under section 9ZA TMA 1970.</p>
<h2 id="using-tax-codes-to-collect-tax-due">Using tax codes to collect tax due</h2>

<p>When a Self Assessment customer receives PAYE income in addition to business income, HMRC will try to collect any Self Assessment tax owed through their tax code for the following tax year.</p>
<p>However, if there is a change in the customer&rsquo;s tax code, it may no longer be possible to collect the tax owed using this method. As a result, any amount collected will be returned to the customer’s account. For more information, refer to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/pay-self-assessment-tax-bill/through-your-tax-code" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pay your Self Assessment tax bill: Through your tax code (GOV.UK)</a>.</p>
<p>‘Coding out’ refers to the use of tax codes to collect tax and debts due to HMRC. The coding out underpayments and debts endpoints in the <a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/self-assessment-accounts-api/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Self Assessment Accounts API</a> enable the customer to complete the following tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li>view coding out underpayment and debt amounts</li>
<li>create or amend coding out underpayment and debt amounts</li>
<li>delete coding out underpayment and debt amounts</li>
</ul>
<p>A customer can view the coded out Self Assessment underpayments stored by HMRC and the amount submitted for the previous tax year at any time. In the software, this is done by calling the <a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/self-assessment-accounts-api/3.0/oas/page#tag/Coding-Out-Underpayments-and-Debts/paths/~1accounts~1self-assessment~1%7Bnino%7D~1%7BtaxYear%7D~1collection~1tax-code/get" rel="noopener noreferrer">Retrieve Coding Out Underpayments and Debt Amounts</a> endpoint.</p>
<p>At the end of the tax year, the customer will review their calculations before submitting the final declaration. If the customer does not agree with the coded out amount in their calculation shown by HMRC, they can submit what they believe to be the correct coded out amount. This can be corrected more than once if needed, but it needs to be done before the final declaration is submitted. In the software, this amendment is done by calling the <a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/self-assessment-accounts-api/3.0/oas/page#tag/Coding-Out-Underpayments-and-Debts/paths/~1accounts~1self-assessment~1%7Bnino%7D~1%7BtaxYear%7D~1collection~1tax-code/put" rel="noopener noreferrer">Create or Amend Coding Out Underpayments and Debt Amounts</a> endpoint. This endpoint can be used only after the tax year has ended.</p>
<p>If the customer has submitted an amendment to the coded out amount after the end of the tax year but later realises they agree with the coded out amount shown by HMRC, they can delete their submitted amount. This deletion needs to be done before the final declaration is submitted. In the software, this deletion is done by calling the <a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/self-assessment-accounts-api/3.0/oas/page#tag/Coding-Out-Underpayments-and-Debts/paths/~1accounts~1self-assessment~1%7Bnino%7D~1%7BtaxYear%7D~1collection~1tax-code/delete" rel="noopener noreferrer">Delete Coding Out Underpayments and Debt Amounts</a> endpoint.</p>
<p>Coding out is specific to the tax year. If a customer opts out of coding out for a specific tax year, they will not be opted out for future tax years.</p>
<p>The software can use the following endpoints to enable customers to:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/self-assessment-accounts-api/3.0/oas/page#tag/Coding-Out-Status/paths/~1accounts~1self-assessment~1{nino}~1{taxYear}~1collection~1tax-code~1coding-out~1opt-out/post" rel="noopener noreferrer">Opt Out of Coding Out</a> </li>

<h2 id="penalties-and-appeals">Penalties and appeals</h2>

<h3 id="penalties-for-late-payment-and-late-submission">Penalties for late payment and late submission</h3>

<p>The way that HMRC penalises late payments and late submissions is changing. From tax year 2024-25 onwards, the changes referred to as &lsquo;Penalty Reform for ITSA&rsquo; will apply to customers who volunteer to test the Making Tax Digital for Income Tax Self Assessment service.</p>
<p>Customers will need to choose to become subject to the new penalty regime and HMRC will confirm in writing when this has taken place. Customers cannot make this choice through software. For more information about how customers will agree to these penalties, refer to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/penalties-for-income-tax-self-assessment-volunteers" rel="noopener noreferrer">Penalties for Income Tax Self Assessment volunteers (GOV.UK)</a>.</p>
<p>For tax years before 2024-25, the existing late payment and late filing penalties continue to apply. For more information, refer to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-tax-returns/penalties" rel="noopener noreferrer">Self Assessment tax returns: Penalties (GOV.UK)</a>.</p>
<h3 id="other-penalties">Other penalties</h3>

<p>Other penalties that apply to Income Tax Self Assessment customers are unchanged by &lsquo;Penalty Reform for ITSA&rsquo; and will continue to be charged where appropriate. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/compliance-checks-penalties-for-inaccuracies-in-returns-or-documents-ccfs7a" rel="noopener noreferrer">Compliance checks: penalties for inaccuracies in returns or documents — Factsheet CC/FS7a</a></li>

</ul>
<h3 id="paying-penalties-and-interest">Paying penalties and interest</h3>

<p>Penalties must be paid within 30 days of the date on the penalty notice. Late payment interest will be charged on penalties that are not paid on time.</p>
<h3 id="appeals">Appeals</h3>

<p>The existing process for appeals, as described in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-when-to-appeal-a-self-assessment-penalty-for-late-filing-or-late-payment" rel="noopener noreferrer">Appeal a Self Assessment penalty for late filing or late payment (GOV.UK)</a>, will remain in place, but a provision will be made as part of &lsquo;Penalty Reform for ITSA&rsquo; to allow a customer to appeal their late submission and late payment penalties through their digital tax account.</p>
<p>A customer or agent may contact HMRC if they have a query about a tax decision. If they do not understand the decision, they can also get advice from HMRC or professional help.</p>
